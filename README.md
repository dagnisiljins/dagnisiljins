### Hi there üëã, I'm Dagnis Iljins!

About Me:

üåç Based in Riga, Latvia, I am a passionate PHP developer with a strong inclination towards the fintech sector. My journey into technology was sparked by the vast possibilities I saw in enhancing the efficiency of not just the fintech field, where I was initially involved, but also various business sectors. This interest, coupled with my brothers' influence in tech, inspired me to delve into this dynamic field.

üöÄ Over the past year, I have been actively engaged in diverse software development projects, both as a project manager and a developer. This experience has allowed me to build a solid foundation in PHP and develop practical solutions for real-world problems.

My Technical Toolkit:

- Languages & Frameworks: Proficient in PHP, with hands-on experience in Laravel.  Also familiar with HTML, CSS, and the basics of VueJS.
- Database Management: Skilled in MySQL.
- Coding Principles: Strong understanding of MVC, SOLID, and design patterns like KISS and DRY.
- Testing: Experienced in Unit & Integration testing, including TDD methods.
- Version Control: Proficient with GIT.

Looking Forward:

I am always eager to learn more and contribute to exciting projects. Feel free to reach out if you think we can collaborate on something amazing!
